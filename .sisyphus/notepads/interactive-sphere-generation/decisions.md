## Decision: Use Viser for Interactive GUI
- Choice: Implemented a full Viser-based GUI in `scripts/generate_spheres.py`.
- Rationale: Provides real-time feedback and parameter tuning for sphere decomposition, which is much more effective than a static script.
- Integration: Reused the structure from `ballpark` to ensure consistency with the underlying sphere decomposition logic.
