# Issues

- Build failed due to missing '@iwsdk/core' dependency in the provided environment. This seems to be a pre-existing issue with the repo or environment configuration, unrelated to the new robot-model component.
- The 'robot-model' component has been created and imported in index.ts, but full verification via build is blocked.
