# dora-rs Interface

TeleopXR can be integrated into [dora-rs](https://dora-rs.ai/) using the
dedicated node available in the dora-hub.

## Dora TeleopXR Node

The official dora-rs integration provides a high-performance node that bridges
WebXR teleoperation data into the dora-rs ecosystem.

  your dora-rs graph.
- **WebSocket Gateway**: High-performance bridging between WebXR clients and
  dora-rs nodes.
- **Configuration**: Easy setup via dora-rs YAML descriptors.
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for real-time teleoperation with minimal overhead.
